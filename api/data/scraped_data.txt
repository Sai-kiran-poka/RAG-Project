Information on Tor Vergata University of Rome
Studying in Rome will add an amazing cultural perspective to the quality of your studies. You will live in a city where you can perceive the passing of time by merely strolling across its central streets: ancient, Middle-Age, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassicial and Modern Rome are ready to be discovered. It is a centre for inter-religious debate and a place where the founding Treaty for the European Union was signed. In Rome you will be able to enjoy all this, surrounded by a gentle climate, arts and music, fashion and food.
The Campus of Tor Vergata University is about 40 minutes tube ride from the historical city centre of the “Eternal City” Rome and 20 minutes far from the peaceful Castelli Romani area, notorious for its vineyards and hillside landscape. Tor Vergata's six Schools (Economics, Engineering, Humanities and Philosophy, Law, Medicine and Surgery, and Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences) are located in a vast 600-hectare campus. Each School is provided with its own library, teaching and research facilities, reading rooms, laboratories, canteens and green areas where students can experience a real campus life.
The School of Medicine and Surgery is part of the important University Hospital compound, the Policlinico Tor Vergata (PTV), where students can benefit from health care and physical emergency assistance. Rome embraces Tor Vergata: let Tor Vergata embrace you!

Villa Mondragone
The beautiful 1573 villa is a congress and event center of Tor Vergata University.
Situated in Monte Porzio Catone near Frascati in a fantastic panoramic position Villa Mondragone, is an event and congress center for Tor Vergata University since 1981.
History
Villa Mondragone was built on the remains of a Roman villa from the 2nd century AD. The first nucleus of the modern villa, known as the "Casino segreto", was built by the Austrian-born cardinal Marco Sittico Altemps starting from 1573, based on a project by Martino Longhi the Elder.
The main purpose of the villa was to host Pope Gregory XIII whose coat of arms was characterized by the presence of a winged dragon, hence the name of the villa: Mondragone.
It was precisely at Villa Mondragone that Pope Gregory XIII promulgated the famous papal bull "Inter gravissimas" which initiated the reform of the Gregorian calendar that we use today. Villa Mondragone was a papal residence until 1626, when Pope Urban VIII moved it to Castel Gandolfo.
In 1613 Villa Mondragone was purchased by Cardinal Scipione Caffarelli Borghese, with whom the entire complex underwent expansion and transformation works in which the Dutch Jan van Santen, known as Giovanni Vasanzio, participated.
The villa was then the favorite residence of Paolina Bonaparte, younger sister of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.
In 1896 it was sold to the "Society of Jesus" to become a famous college, called Nobile Collegio Mondragone for the education of the Italian nobility and upper middle class.
In 1981 the structure and the surrounding park were purchased by the newly formed Tor Vergata University of Rome, which made it its representative office.

Information on Tor Vergata University of Rome
Studying in Rome will add an amazing cultural perspective to the quality of your studies. You will live in a city where you can perceive the passing of time by merely strolling across its central streets: ancient, Middle-Age, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassicial and Modern Rome are ready to be discovered. It is a centre for inter-religious debate and a place where the founding Treaty for the European Union was signed. In Rome you will be able to enjoy all this, surrounded by a gentle climate, arts and music, fashion and food.
The Campus of Tor Vergata University is about 40 minutes tube ride from the historical city centre of the “Eternal City” Rome and 20 minutes far from the peaceful Castelli Romani area, notorious for its vineyards and hillside landscape. Tor Vergata's six Schools (Economics, Engineering, Humanities and Philosophy, Law, Medicine and Surgery, and Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences) are located in a vast 600-hectare campus. Each School is provided with its own library, teaching and research facilities, reading rooms, laboratories, canteens and green areas where students can experience a real campus life.
The School of Medicine and Surgery is part of the important University Hospital compound, the Policlinico Tor Vergata (PTV), where students can benefit from health care and physical emergency assistance. Rome embraces Tor Vergata: let Tor Vergata embrace you!

The University’s ‘Third Mission’
Besides traditional university missions (‘higher education and training’ and ‘research’), “Tor Vergata” is working hard to develop new activities linked to the so called ‘Third Mission’. Through the Third Mission Universities can activate direct interaction processes with the civil society, institutions and the entrepreneurial fabric aiming at promoting social innovation and growth in local areas.

In such field recent agreements with IBM were set up in order to deepen research issues linked to methodology, technologies and innovative ICT applications (Big Data, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Smartcities, etc.). The same goes for the Italian National Body for Microcredit (Ente Nazionale del Microcredito) to create development programmes and support microentrepreneurship.

In this sense, the University of Rome Tor Vergata started an ongoing dialogue with institutions and businesses, offering support to the creation and development of innovative enterprises. In particular, the cooperation between Lazio universities and Lazio production system gave way to the Business Incubator, i.e. a project ‘open’ to businesses and integrated in the region, a strategic hub for academic institutions that have an impact on the same area: Lazio Region and Central-Southern Italy.

Moreover, at the University of Rome Tor Vergata being active in the ‘Third Mission’ means forging a link among the world of university education, schools and workplace, in order for companies and the civil society to find in loco the skills they need and provide young people with a correct guidance to their work placement.

''Tor Vergata'' introduces itself
The University of Rome Tor Vergata was established in 1982: it is therefore a relatively young University. It was designed on the model of Anglo-Saxon campuses: it stretches on 600 hectares and hosts important research institutions, such as CNR and the Italian Space Agency - ASI.
Many other centres are located close to this University, e.g. ENEA, ESA-ESRIN, the National Institute of Astrophysics, Monte Porzio Catone Observatory and the National Institute of Nuclear Physics. Right from the start their presence has contributed to turning "Tor Vergata" into a dynamic research pole.
Furthermore, the Campus hosts one of the most modern hospitals in Italy, i.e. University Hospital Tor Vergata, a care and research centre which is a reference point for the whole Lazio region and where our Medical School is active as well.

The University is situated close to Exit 19-20 of Rome’s Grande Raccordo Anulare, it is well connected and easily reachable. In addition to public transport connections (underground, buses), a free shuttle bus to Tor Vergata railway station was set up too (see section ‘Where we are’).
